## Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture:  
This week has been dedicated for discussing on AWS Billing, setup billing alarms, create IAM user and provide AWS CLI access by creating Access keys.Once AWS account is created, then please ensure you setup billing alarms in order to avoid unwanted charges. Billing depends on AWS regions completely, for each regions, charges would be different, also depends on resources utlization and compute specifications. For example, for an EC2 instances, t2.medium will incur more charges than t2.micro as it cosumes more CPU and memory resources.
